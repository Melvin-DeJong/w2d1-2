DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 160 C fan

Soak 2 lasagna sheets in boiling water.

To make the white sauce; soak the cashews overnight or soak in boiling water for 10 mins. Drain and rinse the cashews. Blend all the cashew sauce ingredients until smooth.

Drain and rinse the lentils and beans for the burger.

In a food processor blend all the burger ingredients until smooth but with a little texture. Shape into 4 burgers.

Heat a large non stick pan on high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and fry each burger on a medium heat until there is a nice crust and they cook through. Remove from the pan and leave aside.

In a separate pan heat 1 Tbsp of oil over high heat. Cut the lasagne sheets in half and drain them being careful they donâ€™t rip. Carefully coat the lasagne sheets in the white sauce. Coat in breadcrumbs straight from the white sauce, reduce the heat to medium and fry until golden brown on each side. Remove from the pan and set aside.

Finely chop 1 clove of garlic and mix with 5 Tbsp of olive oil, set aside.

Drizzle a tbsp of the garlic oil on each side of your bun/bread and pop in the oven for 1-2 minutes to make your garlic bread or else if you have a blow torch use that but be careful!

To make the tomato caper salsa, chop the cherry tomatoes finely, finely dice the red onion and mix with the capers and pinch of salt.

To build your lasagna burger, add sundried tomato pesto to the base and the top of the bun. Add the burger, the crispy lasagna layer, a generous serving of the tomato caper salsa, and some fresh basil leaves. Top with your garlic bread bun & Enjoy!
